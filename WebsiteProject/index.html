        <!--about us-->
        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p class="centerp">
            Our company was founded in 2023 after we noticed that many people in our community did not have access to healthy,
            sustainably grown fruits and vegetables. We pride ourselves on being a family owned business. When we started
            Local Grown Love, we didn't even know it. All of this started with us giving away food to neighbors and friends,
            then showing them how to grow their own food. The turning point was when we started hosting a booth at out local 
            farmer's market. We were blown away by the support that we received. This was when we knew that our passion growing
            our own food could really make an impact.
