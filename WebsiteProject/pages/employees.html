                <h2>Alexis Greene, Founder</h2>
                <p>Phone Extension: #1</p>
                <p>Alexis started Local Grown Love with the help of her husband and mother in June of 2023. As a stay at home
                    Mom of 3 kids, Alexis was constantly running around to sports games, school events, and events with other
                    parents. As her kids got older, she noticed more and more of a need for local grown food in her community.
                    She hopes that Local Grown Love can continue to fill that gap. In her free time, she likes to paint, go for
                    walks, and spend time with her family. 
                </p></div>

                <h2>Mark Greene, Produce Coordinator</h2>
                <p>Phone Extension: #2</p>
                <p>Mark joined the team in late 2024 after it became increasingly clear that Local Grown Love was becoming a 
                    staple in the community. He loves being able to work towards a common goal of nourishing people
                    with his wife Alexis. In his free time, he likes to spend time with his wife and children, go fishing,
                    and play in the local adult tennis league</p></div>

                <h2>Sarah Watts, Co-Founder</h2>
                <p>Phone Extension: #3</p>
                <p>Sarah has been with us from the start. The matriarch of the family, she has been an integral part of 
                    our business. Without her, the passion for homegrown food would not have been passed down to Alexis. You may 
                    have met her before at one of her pottery classes she teaches out of her house. In her free time,
                    she enjoys creating and teaching pottery, painting, reading, and taking her dog Trix for walks.
