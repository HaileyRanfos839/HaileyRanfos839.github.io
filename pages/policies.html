        <h2>Financing Policies</h2>

        <p class="centerp">
            We want to be able to work with the community to find a solution for everyone to be able to enjoy
            farm fresh produce! We accept: Cash, Check, Credit Card, and Venmo. Please be aware that a 3% program
            fee will be added to all credit card purchases. Unique to small businesses, we are willing to work with
            what you have to barter! On a case by case basis, we are willing to discuss payments outside of currency
            such as other goods and services.
